viewModelScope.launch is used to launch a coroutine within the scope of a ViewModel. The viewModelScope is an extension property available in the androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-viewmodel-ktx library, which provides a CoroutineScope specifically designed for ViewModels.

When you launch a coroutine using viewModelScope.launch, the coroutine is automatically canceled if the ViewModel is cleared. This is useful for work that needs to be done only if the ViewModel is active, such as network calls or other background tasks. By using viewModelScope, you can ensure that resources are not wasted if the ViewModel is no longer in use developer.android.com.

In the PostViewModel example, viewModelScope.launch is used to fetch the list of posts in a coroutine:

fun getPostList() {
    viewModelScope.launch {
        // Fetch the list of posts and update the state
    }
}
By using viewModelScope.launch, the coroutine will automatically be canceled if the ViewModel is cleared, avoiding potential resource leaks and ensuring that the work is only done while the ViewModel is active medium.com.
