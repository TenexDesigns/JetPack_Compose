LaunchedEffect is a Jetpack Compose composable function that is used to launch coroutines from within a composable function. When LaunchedEffect enters the composition, it launches a coroutine with the block of code passed as a parameter developer.android.com. It runs its lambda as soon as it enters the composition and will run it again whenever one of the given keys changes composables.com.

The key parameters control the behavior of the coroutine through recompositions. As long as the values of any of the key parameters remain unchanged, LaunchedEffect will keep the same coroutine running through multiple recompositions of the parent composable. If a key value changes, however, LaunchedEffect will cancel the current coroutine and launch a new one answertopia.com.

In the context of the Display composable function, LaunchedEffect is used to fetch the data when the composable is launched:

@Composable
fun Display() {
    // Get a reference to the ViewModel
    val postViewModel = viewModel<PostViewModel>()

    // Fetch the data when the Display composable is launched
    LaunchedEffect(Unit) {
        postViewModel.getPostList()
    }

    // Display the posts
    // ...
}
By using LaunchedEffect, you ensure that the getPostList() function is called when the Display composable is launched, and the coroutine is automatically canceled if the composable is disposed of, avoiding potential resource leaks and ensuring that the work is only done while the composable is active.
