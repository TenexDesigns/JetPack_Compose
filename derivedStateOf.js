derivedStateOf is a function in Jetpack Compose that is used to create a state object that changes only as much as you need. It is like distinctUntilChanged from Kotlin Flows or other similar reactive frameworks.

derivedStateOf should be used when your state or key is changing more than you want to update your UI. Essentially, it allows you to create a state object that is derived from one or more other state objects and only updates when the derived value has changed.

Here is an example:

import androidx.compose.runtime.mutableStateOf
import androidx.compose.runtime.derivedStateOf

val username = mutableStateOf("")
val isUsernameValid = derivedStateOf { username.value.length >= 3 }
In this example, isUsernameValid is a derived state that updates only when the length of username is 3 or more characters. As the user types into the username field, isUsernameValid will only change from false to true once, when the length of the username reaches 3. Even if the user continues typing, isUsernameValid will not change again unless the username becomes less than 3 characters long.

However, derivedStateOf should not be used to combine multiple states together if you want recomposition to happen any time one of them changes. For instance, if you have a form that takes in a first name and last name and displays a full name, derivedStateOf will not be beneficial because the output changes just as much as the input.

To sum up, derivedStateOf is useful when you want to create a state that is derived from one or more other states and only changes when the derived value has changed. If there is no difference in the amount of change between the input arguments and output result, you don't need to use derivedStateOf medium.com.

  In Jetpack Compose, derivedStateOf is a utility function that allows you to derive a state value based on one or more other state values. It is useful when you have a complex state transformation or computation that depends on multiple state variables, and you want to update a derived value only when the dependencies change.

Here's an example of how to use derivedStateOf in Jetpack Compose:

kotlin
Copy code
import androidx.compose.runtime.Composable
import androidx.compose.runtime.mutableStateOf
import androidx.compose.runtime.getValue
import androidx.compose.runtime.derivedStateOf
import androidx.compose.runtime.setValue
import androidx.compose.ui.platform.LocalContext
import androidx.compose.ui.text.font.FontWeight
import androidx.compose.ui.unit.sp
import androidx.compose.ui.tooling.preview.Preview

@Composable
fun CounterExample() {
    var count by mutableStateOf(0)
    
    val isEven by derivedStateOf {
        count % 2 == 0
    }

    val textStyle = if (isEven) {
        androidx.compose.ui.text.TextStyle(fontSize = 24.sp, fontWeight = FontWeight.Bold)
    } else {
        androidx.compose.ui.text.TextStyle(fontSize = 16.sp, fontWeight = FontWeight.Normal)
    }

    androidx.compose.material.Text(
        text = "Count: $count",
        style = textStyle
    )

    androidx.compose.material.Button(
        onClick = {
            count++
        }
    ) {
        androidx.compose.material.Text(text = "Increment")
    }
}

@Preview
@Composable
fun CounterExamplePreview() {
    CounterExample()
}
In this example, we have a CounterExample composable that displays a count and a button to increment the count. We also have a derived state isEven, which is a boolean value indicating whether the count is even or not. The isEven state is derived using the derivedStateOf function, which takes a lambda expression defining the derivation logic.

Inside the lambda expression, we define that isEven is true if count % 2 == 0. Whenever count changes, isEven is automatically recomputed.

Based on the value of isEven, we define a textStyle variable that changes the font size and weight of the text accordingly. This demonstrates how the derived state can be used to affect the UI presentation based on the state dependencies.

Note that derivedStateOf is memoized, meaning that it caches the computed value and only recomputes it when the dependencies change. This helps optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary recomputations.

You can use derivedStateOf to derive state based on multiple variables, perform complex computations, or filter and transform data based on certain conditions.
