To use R8 to shrink the code in your Jetpack Compose app, you need to configure it in your project. R8 is a code shrinker and optimizer provided by Google that can help reduce the size of your application's bytecode.

Here's how you can configure R8 for your Jetpack Compose app:

Open your project's build.gradle file (the one at the project level) and add the following lines inside the buildscript section:
groovy
Copy code
buildscript {
    // Other configurations

    dependencies {
        // Other dependencies
        classpath 'com.android.tools:r8:<version>'
    }
}
Replace <version> with the desired version of R8. You can check the latest version from the Android Gradle Plugin release notes.

In the build.gradle file of your app module, apply the R8 plugin and enable code shrinking by adding the following lines at the top of the file:
groovy
Copy code
apply plugin: 'com.android.application'
apply plugin: 'com.android.application'
Still in the same file, configure R8 by adding the following lines:
groovy
Copy code
android {
    // Other configurations

    buildTypes {
        release {
            // Other configurations

            minifyEnabled true
            shrinkResources true
            proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android-optimize.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
        }
    }
}
Here, minifyEnabled true enables code shrinking, while shrinkResources true tells R8 to remove unused resources.

Create a proguard-rules.pro file in the root directory of your app module (next to the build.gradle file). In this file, you can specify additional rules for code shrinking. Here's an example rule to keep all Jetpack Compose-related classes:
kotlin
Copy code
-keep class androidx.compose.** { *; }
You can add more rules based on your app's specific requirements.

Build your app in release mode. You can do this either by running ./gradlew assembleRelease in the terminal or by using the "Generate Signed Bundle/APK" option in Android Studio.
R8 will now process your code and resources, removing unused code and resources, and optimizing the resulting bytecode. The resulting APK should have a smaller size compared to the non-shrunk version.

It's worth noting that R8 automatically applies some default optimizations. If you encounter any issues with specific features or libraries in your app after enabling code shrinking, you may need to add additional rules to the proguard-rules.pro file to keep those features intact.

Make sure to thoroughly test your app after applying code shrinking to ensure that all functionality is working correctly.

  R8 is a tool for code shrinking, obfuscation, and optimization. It removes unused code and resources, shortens the names of classes and members, and applies aggressive strategies to further reduce the size of your app.

To enable R8 in your Android project, you need to add the following lines to your gradle.properties file:

android.enableR8=true
This will enable R8 for both app and test code. If you only want to enable R8 for app code, you should add:

android.enableR8.fullMode=true
To enable code shrinking in your project, you need to set the minifyEnabled property to true in your app-level build.gradle file:

android {
    buildTypes {
        release {
            minifyEnabled true
            proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android-optimize.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
        }
    }
}
In this configuration, minifyEnabled true enables code shrinking, and proguardFiles specifies the ProGuard configuration files. R8 is fully backwards-compatible with existing ProGuard rules, so you can use the same configuration files for both ProGuard and R8.

R8 determines which code to keep and which to remove based on -keep rules specified in the ProGuard configuration files. By default, the Android Gradle plugin and AAPT2 generate keep rules that are required by most app projects.

If you need to customize this default behavior with additional keep rules, you can do so in your ProGuard configuration files. For instance, to keep all public classes in a specific package, you could add:

-keep public class com.example.myapp.** { *; }
This rule tells R8 to keep all public classes in the com.example.myapp package, and not to remove or rename any of their methods or fields.

To enable resource shrinking, set the shrinkResources property to true in your build.gradle file:

android {
    buildTypes {
        release {
            minifyEnabled true
            shrinkResources true
            proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android-optimize.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
        }
    }
}
Resource shrinking removes unused resources from your packaged app, including unused resources in your appâ€™s library dependencies developer.android.com, blog.mindorks.com.
