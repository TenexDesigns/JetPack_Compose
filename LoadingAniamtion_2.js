To create a loading animation with three circles moving up and down on the y-axis, you can use Jetpack Compose's built-in animation capabilities along with state management. Here's an example of how you can implement this animation:

kotlin
Copy code
@Composable
fun LoadingAnimation() {
    val transition = rememberInfiniteTransition()

    // Animation values for circle positions
    val circle1Y by transition.animateFloat(
        initialValue = -40f,
        targetValue = 40f,
        animationSpec = infiniteRepeatable(
            animation = tween(durationMillis = 1000, easing = LinearEasing),
            repeatMode = RepeatMode.Reverse
        )
    )
    val circle2Y by transition.animateFloat(
        initialValue = 0f,
        targetValue = 80f,
        animationSpec = infiniteRepeatable(
            animation = tween(durationMillis = 1000, easing = LinearEasing),
            repeatMode = RepeatMode.Reverse
        )
    )
    val circle3Y by transition.animateFloat(
        initialValue = 40f,
        targetValue = 0f,
        animationSpec = infiniteRepeatable(
            animation = tween(durationMillis = 1000, easing = LinearEasing),
            repeatMode = RepeatMode.Reverse
        )
    )

    Box(
        modifier = Modifier
            .fillMaxSize()
            .padding(16.dp),
        contentAlignment = Alignment.Center
    ) {
        // Render the circles with animated positions
        Circle(Modifier.offset(y = circle1Y))
        Circle(Modifier.offset(y = circle2Y))
        Circle(Modifier.offset(y = circle3Y))
    }
}

@Composable
fun Circle(modifier: Modifier = Modifier) {
    Box(
        modifier = modifier
            .size(40.dp)
            .clip(CircleShape)
            .background(Color.Blue)
    )
}
In this example, the LoadingAnimation composable uses the rememberInfiniteTransition to create an infinite transition. The animateFloat function is used to animate the y-axis positions of three circles. Each circle's targetValue is set to a specific position, and the infiniteRepeatable animation with a tween duration and LinearEasing is applied to create the continuous up and down movement.

The Box composable is used to position and center the circles. Inside the Box, the Circle composable is used to render each circle. The offset modifier is used to apply the animated y-axis positions to each circle.

To show the loading animation until the data is loaded, you can conditionally render the LoadingAnimation composable based on a loading state. For example:

kotlin
Copy code
@Composable
fun Display() {
    val isLoading = remember { mutableStateOf(true) }
    
    // Simulate loading delay
    LaunchedEffect(Unit) {
        delay(2000)
        isLoading.value = false
    }

    if (isLoading.value) {
        LoadingAnimation()
    } else {
        // Display loaded data
        LazyColumn {
            // ...
        }
    }
}
In this example, the isLoading state is initially set to true. After a simulated delay of 2000 milliseconds, it is set to false to indicate that the data is loaded. During the loading state, the LoadingAnimation is displayed. Once the loading is complete, you can render the loaded data using LazyColumn or other appropriate Compose components.

This is just one example of a loading animation in Jetpack Compose. Here are a few other ideas for loading animations and their potential implementations:

Progress Bar: Use a LinearProgressIndicator or CircularProgressIndicator to display a progress bar that fills or rotates while loading.

Skeleton Screens: Create skeleton-like representations of UI components that give the impression of content loading. You can use custom shapes and animations to mimic loading effects.

Shimmer Effect: Apply a shimmering effect to indicate loading. You can use the Shimmer library or create custom animations with Compose.

Gradient Animation: Create a gradient animation that moves or changes colors to indicate loading. Use the animateColorAsState or animateFloatAsState to animate the gradient.

Remember to import the necessary dependencies based on the specific animation you choose to implement.

I hope these examples and ideas help you create loading animations in Jetpack Compose. Feel free to customize and combine different animation techniques to achieve the desired effect.

To create a loading animation of three circles moving up and down along the y-axis, you can use animateFloatAsState to animate the translation along the y-axis for each circle. Here is an example:

@Composable
fun LoadingAnimation() {
    val infiniteTransition = rememberInfiniteTransition()
    val circle1OffsetY by infiniteTransition.animateFloat(
        initialValue = 0f,
        targetValue = 50f,
        animationSpec = infiniteRepeatable(
            animation = tween(1000, easing = LinearEasing),
            repeatMode = RepeatMode.Reverse
        )
    )
    val circle2OffsetY by infiniteTransition.animateFloat(
        initialValue = 0f,
        targetValue = 50f,
        animationSpec = infiniteRepeatable(
            animation = tween(1000, delayMillis = 300, easing = LinearEasing),
            repeatMode = RepeatMode.Reverse
        )
    )
    val circle3OffsetY by infiniteTransition.animateFloat(
        initialValue = 0f,
        targetValue = 50f,
        animationSpec = infiniteRepeatable(
            animation = tween(1000, delayMillis = 600, easing = LinearEasing),
            repeatMode = RepeatMode.Reverse
        )
    )

    Row(
        modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize(),
        horizontalArrangement = Arrangement.Center,
        verticalAlignment = Alignment.CenterVertically
    ) {
        Circle(Modifier.offset(y = circle1OffsetY.dp))
        Spacer(Modifier.width(20.dp))
        Circle(Modifier.offset(y = circle2OffsetY.dp))
        Spacer(Modifier.width(20.dp))
        Circle(Modifier.offset(y = circle3OffsetY.dp))
    }
}

@Composable
fun Circle(modifier: Modifier = Modifier) {
    Box(
        modifier = modifier
            .size(50.dp)
            .background(Color.Blue, shape = CircleShape)
    )
}
In this code, rememberInfiniteTransition is used to create an infinite animation. animateFloat is used to animate the offset of each circle along the y-axis. Each circle has a different start delay to create a wave effect. The Circle function is used to draw each circle.

To show the loaded data after the loading animation, you can use LaunchedEffect to delay showing the data for a certain amount of time. Here is an example:

@Composable
fun LoadingAndData() {
    var showData by remember { mutableStateOf(false) }

    LaunchedEffect(Unit) {
        delay(3000) // delay for 3 seconds
        showData = true
    }

    Box(modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize()) {
        if (showData) {
            // Show your data here
            Text(text = "Data Loaded", Modifier.align(Alignment.Center))
        } else {
            LoadingAnimation()
        }
    }
}
In this code, LaunchedEffect is used to delay setting showData to true for 3 seconds. Before showData is true, the loading animation is shown. After showData is true, the data is shown developer.android.com.

As for other loading animation ideas:

Rotating logo: You can have your app's logo rotate as a loading animation. This is similar to the rotating square example given earlier, but instead of a square, you use an Image of your logo.
Fade in and out: You can have a shape or image fade in and out as a loading animation. You would use animateFloatAsState to animate the alpha of the shape or image.
Progress bar: You can have a progress bar that fills up over time as a loading animation. You would use LinearProgressIndicator with a animateFloatAsState to animate the progress.
Color changing: You can have a shape or image change color over time as a loading animation. You would use animateColorAsState to animate the color of the shape or image proandroiddev.com.
