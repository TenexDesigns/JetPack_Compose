Android's Jetpack Compose library has numerous dependencies, each with its own version number. Keeping track of and managing these versions can be a bit of a hassle. To simplify this, Android introduced the Jetpack Compose Bill of Materials (BOM). The BOM is a single dependency that defines versions for all Compose libraries that are compatible with each other.

To use the Jetpack Compose BOM, you first need to add it to your build.gradle file. Here's how:

dependencies {
    // Defines versions for all Compose libraries
    implementation platform('androidx.compose:compose-bom:1.0.0')

    // No version needed for these libraries as they are defined by the BOM
    implementation 'androidx.compose.ui:ui'
    implementation 'androidx.compose.material:material'
    implementation 'androidx.compose.ui:ui-tooling'
    // ... any other Compose libraries
}
In this example, androidx.compose:compose-bom:1.0.0 is the BOM, and it specifies the versions for all of the Compose libraries listed under it. You don't need to specify a version for these libraries, as the version is defined by the BOM.

The BOM ensures that all of your Compose libraries use the same version, which can help prevent compatibility issues. It also makes your build.gradle file cleaner and easier to manage medium.com.

Starting from Compose version 1.0.0, a Compose BOM (Bill of Materials) has been introduced, which allows you to use a single dependency to manage all the Compose-related libraries and versions. The Compose BOM simplifies the dependency management process and ensures that all Compose libraries are compatible with each other.

To use the Compose BOM, follow these steps:

Add the Compose BOM to your project's build.gradle file:
groovy
Copy code
dependencies {
    // ...

    implementation platform('androidx.compose.ui:ui-bom:1.0.0')
}
Declare the Compose libraries you want to use with their corresponding versions:
groovy
Copy code
dependencies {
    // ...

    implementation 'androidx.compose.ui:ui'
    implementation 'androidx.compose.material:material'
    implementation 'androidx.compose.runtime:runtime'
    // Add other Compose libraries as needed
}
By specifying the ui-bom dependency as a platform, you can omit specifying the versions for individual Compose libraries. The BOM will automatically manage the versions for you, ensuring compatibility among the Compose libraries.

Sync your project to fetch the dependencies and their corresponding versions.
Now, you can use Compose libraries in your project without worrying about managing individual version numbers. The Compose BOM ensures that all the libraries are in sync and compatible with each other.

Here's an example of how you can use the Compose BOM with Compose version 1.0.0:

kotlin
Copy code
import androidx.compose.material.Text
import androidx.compose.runtime.Composable
import androidx.compose.ui.platform.ComposeView

@Composable
fun MyComposable() {
    Text(text = "Hello, Compose!")
}

class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContent {
            ComposeView(this) {
                MyComposable()
            }
        }
    }
}
In this example, the ui-bom dependency is used to manage the Compose versions. The Text composable from androidx.compose.material and the ComposeView from androidx.compose.ui.platform can be used without explicitly specifying their versions.

Using the Compose BOM simplifies the dependency management process and ensures that all Compose libraries are compatible with each other, making it easier to stay up-to-date with the latest Compose releases.
