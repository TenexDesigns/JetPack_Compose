A suspend function is a special kind of function in Kotlin that can be paused and resumed at a later time without blocking the current thread. Suspend functions are primarily used with Kotlin coroutines, which are lightweight and non-blocking units of asynchronous work amitshekhar.me.

The main advantage of using suspend functions is that they allow you to write asynchronous code in a more sequential and readable manner. Suspend functions can only be called from another suspend function or within a coroutine geeksforgeeks.org.

In the given context, we used a suspend function in the PostService interface:

interface PostService {
    @GET("posts")
    suspend fun getPostList(): Response<List<PostResponse>>
}
The reason for using a suspend function here is to make the network call asynchronous and non-blocking. By marking the getPostList() function as suspend, you can call it within a coroutine without blocking the UI thread, allowing the app to remain responsive while fetching data from the API amitshekhar.me.

In the PostViewModel, we call the getPostList() suspend function within a coroutine using viewModelScope.launch, which ensures that the network call is executed asynchronously:

fun getPostList() {
    viewModelScope.launch {
        val postService = ServiceBuilder.buildService(PostService::class.java)
        try {
            val response = postService.getPostList().await()
            // ...
        } catch (e: Exception) {
            // ...
        }
    }
}
By using suspend functions and coroutines, you can write asynchronous code in a more structured and readable way, making it easier to maintain and understand.
