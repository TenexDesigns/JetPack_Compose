-----------------------------------------------------------------
To add icons to your Jetpack Compose app, including third-party icons, you can use the Icon composable along with different sources for icons. Here's how you can do it:

Add dependencies:
Make sure you have the necessary dependencies in your build.gradle file:
groovy
Copy code
implementation "androidx.compose.material:material-icons-core:${compose_version}"
implementation "androidx.compose.material:material-icons-extended:${compose_version}"
Replace ${compose_version} with the version of Jetpack Compose you are using.

Import the required classes:
kotlin
Copy code
import androidx.compose.material.Icon
import androidx.compose.material.icons.Icons
import androidx.compose.material.icons.filled.*
import androidx.compose.material.icons.outlined.*
import androidx.compose.ui.graphics.vector.ImageVector
Use built-in icons:
Jetpack Compose provides a set of built-in icons that you can use directly. For example:
kotlin
Copy code
Icon(Icons.Default.Favorite, contentDescription = "Favorite Icon")
Icon(Icons.Outlined.Home, contentDescription = "Home Icon")
Here, Icons.Default.Favorite and Icons.Outlined.Home refer to the built-in icons provided by Jetpack Compose. You can explore the available icons in the Icons.Default and Icons.Outlined classes.

Use custom icons:
To use custom icons, you need to obtain an ImageVector for the desired icon. There are several ways to achieve this:
Using a third-party icon library: Many icon libraries provide support for Compose. For example, you can use the compose-icons library, which offers a wide range of icons. To use it, add the following dependency to your build.gradle file:

groovy
Copy code
implementation "io.github.compose-icons:core:${compose_icons_version}"
Replace ${compose_icons_version} with the version of compose-icons you want to use. Then, you can use the icons provided by the library as follows:

kotlin
Copy code
Icon(ComposeIcons.Filled.Camera, contentDescription = "Camera Icon")
Here, ComposeIcons.Filled.Camera represents the camera icon from the compose-icons library. You can explore the available icons in the library's documentation.

Using SVG files: If you have custom SVG icons, you can convert them to ImageVector using the vectorResource function. Place the SVG file in the res/drawable directory of your Android project. Then, you can load it as an ImageVector like this:

kotlin
Copy code
val customIcon: ImageVector = vectorResource(R.drawable.custom_icon)
Icon(customIcon, contentDescription = "Custom Icon")

Jetpack Compose provides the Icon API for working with icons. The Icon composable function takes an ImageVector and a contentDescription as parameters.

By default, Jetpack Compose comes with a limited set of Material Design icons. You can add the following dependency in your app-level build.gradle file to get access to all the Material icons:

implementation "androidx.compose.material:material-icons-extended:$compose_version"
Replace $compose_version with your current Jetpack Compose version.

Here's an example of how to use an icon:

Icon(
    imageVector = Icons.Default.Person,
    contentDescription = "Person Icon"
)
In this example, the Person icon from the default Material Design icons is used semicolonspace.com.

Moreover, you can make the Icon clickable by using the clickable() modifier:

Icon(
    modifier = Modifier.clickable {
        /* Handle click event */
    },
    imageVector = Icons.Default.Person,
    contentDescription = "Person Icon"
)
If you wish to use third-party icons, you can create an ImageBitmap from a bitmap and use it with the Image composable:

val bitmap: Bitmap = ... // Load your bitmap
val imageBitmap = bitmap.asImageBitmap()

Image(
    bitmap = imageBitmap,
    contentDescription = "Custom Icon"
)
In this example, you need to replace the ... with your code for loading the bitmap semicolonspace.com.

Note: The dependency "androidx.compose.material:material-icons-extended:$compose_version" increases the app size. It's recommended to use ProGuard or R8 to shrink the code semicolonspace.com.

SOURCES





























Here, R.drawable.custom_icon refers to the custom SVG file located in the res/drawable directory.

With these approaches, you can add both built-in and custom icons to your Jetpack Compose app.
