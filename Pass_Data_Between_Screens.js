Passing identifiers like IDs and fetching the data in the destination screen is a recommended way to navigate between screens using Navigation Compose. This approach is more efficient and less error-prone compared to passing Parcelable objects.

Here's how you can implement it:

First, define your routes with the parameters they will require. In this case, we'll assume that we're navigating from a list screen to a details screen, and the details screen needs an ID to fetch the correct data.

val navController = rememberNavController()

navController.composable(
    route = "details/{id}",
    arguments = listOf(navArgument("id") {
        type = NavType.LongType
    })
) { backStackEntry ->
    val id = backStackEntry.arguments?.getLong("id")
    DetailsScreen(id)
}
Here, we've defined a route that expects an ID. We use navArgument to define the argument and specify its type as LongType. In the DetailsScreen, we retrieve the ID using backStackEntry.arguments?.getLong("id").

Now, when we want to navigate to the details screen, we simply pass the ID as a parameter in the route:

val id = 1000L
navController.navigate("details/$id")
In the DetailsScreen, we can use the ID to fetch the data we need:

@Composable
fun DetailsScreen(id: Long?) {
    // Fetch the data using the ID
    val data = fetchData(id)

    // Display the data
    Text(text = data.toString())
}
This way, we only pass the ID between screens, and each screen is responsible for fetching its own data. This approach is more scalable and less likely to cause issues compared to passing Parcelable objects composables.co.

Sure! To pass identifiers (like IDs) between screens and fetch data in the destination screen, you can combine the use of navigation arguments and ViewModel. Here's an example:

Define your destination screen composable:
kotlin
Copy code
@Composable
fun DestinationScreen(id: String, viewModel: MyViewModel) {
    // Fetch data based on the ID
    val data = viewModel.getDataById(id)

    // Rest of your destination screen composable
}
In this example, the DestinationScreen composable takes an id parameter and a viewModel instance. It uses the id to fetch data from the viewModel using the getDataById function.

Set up your NavGraph and ViewModel:
kotlin
Copy code
@Composable
fun NavGraph(viewModel: MyViewModel) {
    val navController = rememberNavController()

    NavHost(navController, startDestination = "list") {
        composable("list") {
            ListScreen(navController, viewModel)
        }
        composable("detail/{id}") { backStackEntry ->
            val id = backStackEntry.arguments?.getString("id")
            id?.let { DestinationScreen(it, viewModel) }
        }
    }
}
In this example, the NavGraph composable sets up your navigation flow. The ListScreen is the starting destination, and the DetailScreen is the destination where you pass the ID. The DetailScreen composable retrieves the ID from the navigation arguments and passes it to the DestinationScreen composable.

Navigating from the list to the detail screen:
kotlin
Copy code
@Composable
fun ListScreen(navController: NavController, viewModel: MyViewModel) {
    // Trigger navigation to detail screen with an ID
    val onItemClick: (String) -> Unit = { id ->
        navController.navigate("detail/$id")
    }

    // Display list of items
    val itemList = viewModel.getItemList()
    LazyColumn {
        items(itemList) { item ->
            ListItem(item, onItemClick)
        }
    }
}
In this example, the ListScreen composable displays a list of items retrieved from the viewModel. When an item is clicked, it triggers navigation to the detail screen by passing the corresponding ID to the navigation route.

By combining these steps, you can pass identifiers between screens and fetch data in the destination screen based on the provided ID. Remember to set up your ViewModel (MyViewModel) to handle data retrieval based on IDs and provide it to the NavGraph and destination screens.
