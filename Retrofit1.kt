There are app we make that are native and can be used as they have all that they rquire.
But  for oue apps to be more expanded it has to connect to the intenert and aceess web services such as e.g apis giving images,
Our app sends this http reuest and the receiving web server send the http response.
How ever handling sending this https request and receinging the http response in our app is very hard.
That is where our retefit libray comes in .


Retrofit is used to  handle the retrieve, update and delete of  the data from web services.

                                   http response                    
client  <--->   retrofit   <--->                  <------->   web services(webs erver)
                                   http request
