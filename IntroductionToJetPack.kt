JETPACKCOMPOS - Is a modern ui toolkit designed to simplyfy ui development and it combines reactive programing modl with the power of kotlin
Jetpack is fully declarative - Meaning you describe your ui by calling a series of functions that transorm data into your y=ui hierachy.
and when ever the underlying data changes the framework automaticaly recalls this functions updating the view hierachy for you.


THIS MEANS THAT 
From now on if you want to build your app with jetpack compose you ar not going to need any xml files for declaring any ui content
Instead you are going to build your UI using  @Composable functions.
Composable functions are highly usable

XML is not yet depricated . You can still build app using fragments and xml or even combine that with jetpack compose


JETPACK COMPOSE 
Also supportsMVVM out of the box
This means that it will be easier to arrange our code into smaller chunks


LIFE CYCLE OF OUR COMPOSABLE
You need to understand Intial composition and Recomposition


LIFE CYCLE 

step 1               

Enter the composition


Step 2

Recompose ) or more times  { composable}
