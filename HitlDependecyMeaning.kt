Dependecy Injection EXPLAINED
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used to provide the objects that an object depends on (its dependencies)
rather than having the object create those dependencies itself. 
In Android, DI can be used to simplify the management of dependencies in your app and reduce the amount of boilerplate code 
required to create and manage those dependencies.

In simpler terms, Dependency Injection is a way of providing objects with the dependencies they need,
instead of those objects creating or searching for those dependencies themselves.

There are several benefits of using Dependency Injection in Android:

1.Separation of Concerns:
DI separates the construction of objects from their usage, which makes it easier to manage the dependencies between objects.

2.Testability:
With DI, you can easily swap out dependencies with mock objects for testing, which makes it easier to write unit tests for your app.

3.Code Reusability: 
DI allows you to reuse objects with their dependencies across different parts of your app, which makes your code more modular and reusable.

4.Easier Maintenance:
DI can make your code more organized and easier to maintain, as it reduces the complexity of managing dependencies.


In summary, Dependency Injection is a design pattern that helps to manage the dependencies between objects in your Android app. 
By providing objects with their dependencies, it makes your code more modular, easier to maintain, and more testable.









HILT DAGGER EXPLAINED
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Dagger Hilt is a dependency injection library for Android that simplifies the implementation of the Dependency Injection (DI) pattern 
in your app. 
Dagger Hilt is built on top of the popular Dagger 2 library and provides an easy way to inject dependencies into your apps components.

Here are some common uses of Dagger Hilt:


1.Dependency Injection:
Dagger Hilt simplifies the implementation of dependency injection in Android apps.
With Hilt, you can define the dependencies of your app and inject them into the appropriate components.

2.Scoping:
Hilt provides a set of predefined scopes that you can use to define the lifespan of your dependencies.
This makes it easy to manage the lifecycle of your apps objects and prevent memory leaks.

3.ViewModels: 
Hilt provides built-in support for injecting dependencies into ViewModels.
This allows you to easily create and manage ViewModels with all the required dependencies.

4.Fragment injection:
Hilt provides a way to inject dependencies into Fragments using the @AndroidEntryPoint annotation.

5.Testing:
Hilt makes it easy to write unit tests for your app by allowing you to easily mock dependencies and replace them with test doubles.


Overall, Dagger Hilt is a powerful tool that can simplify the implementation of dependency injection in your Android app,
making it easier to manage the lifecycle of your apps objects and reduce boilerplate code.




USING hilt with retrofit
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Hilt can be used with Retrofit to make it easier to inject dependencies and manage the lifecycle of objects that are
used for fetching data over the internet.

Here are the steps to use Hilt and Retrofit together:



Add the required dependencies: 
Add the following dependencies to your app-level build.gradle file

implementation 'com.google.dagger:hilt-android:2.40.5'
kapt 'com.google.dagger:hilt-compiler:2.40.5'
implementation 'com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:2.9.0'
implementation 'com.squareup.retrofit2:converter-gson:2.9.0'


Define the Retrofit interface:
Create an interface that defines the API endpoints for your web service using the Retrofit annotations. For example:

interface ApiService {
    @GET("/posts")
    suspend fun getPosts(): List<Post>
}


Create a Retrofit instance:
Create a Retrofit instance by calling Retrofit.Builder() and setting the base URL and converter factory.

val retrofit = Retrofit.Builder()
    .baseUrl("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/")
    .addConverterFactory(GsonConverterFactory.create())
    .build()



Create a Hilt module:
Create a Hilt module to provide the Retrofit instance as a dependency. For example:

@Module
@InstallIn(ApplicationComponent::class)
object NetworkModule {
    @Provides
    fun provideApiService(): ApiService {
        return retrofit.create(ApiService::class.java)
    }
}


Inject the dependency:
Inject the ApiService dependency into the class that will use it by adding the @Inject annotation to the property.

class MyViewModel @Inject constructor(
    private val apiService: ApiService
) : ViewModel() {
    // Use the apiService to fetch data
}


Use the dependency: 
Use the injected dependency to fetch data. For example:


class MyViewModel @Inject constructor(
    private val apiService: ApiService
) : ViewModel() {
    fun fetchData() {
        viewModelScope.launch {
            val posts = apiService.getPosts()
            // Do something with the posts
        }
    }
}


In summary, Hilt can be used with Retrofit to simplify the management of dependencies and 
the lifecycle of objects that are used for fetching data over the internet. By providing a way to inject dependencies into classes,
Hilt makes it easier to manage the complexity of dependency injection in your Android app.
